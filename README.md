## Simulations
When testing the results of this project, researchers should follow several steps:
1. Download all the files and arrange them like in the ## Files section.
2. According to requirements.txt, prepare the python environment and libraries.
3. Run the scripts according to the order showed in main.py file.
4. Open the dashboard.html to check the results.

## Project 3 Description

This project represents the final stage of our multi-phase pipeline analyzing FSRDC-related research outputs. It involved consolidating datasets from eight independent student groups, each of which explored top researchers, institutions, and topics using different methodologies.

Our primary objective was to develop a scalable, validated, and enriched dataset that could serve as a unified foundation for advanced analysis. To achieve this, we engineered a robust Python pipeline that:

- Normalized and deduplicated data from over 39,000 raw records
- Applied fuzzy matching and TF-IDF similarity to validate project affiliations
- Enriched incomplete entries using the CrossRef and OpenAlex APIs
- Merged final results with official metadata from ResearchOutputs.xlsx

We then conducted a series of analytical tasks using Python:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Top RDCs by output volume
- Most prolific authors
- Publication trends and citation distribution
- Time-to-publication lag

### Machine Learning and NLP:
- Trained classification models to predict output status
- Performed PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Clustered documents using K-Means and Agglomerative methods
- Applied LDA topic modeling to identify core research themes
- Conducted sentiment analysis on research abstracts
- Built a document similarity network to reveal local content clusters

### Trend & Network Analysis:
- Tracked keyword frequency shifts over time
- Clustered authors based on aggregated research themes
- Visualized document interconnections via a degree distribution network

All findings are published on our interactive [GitHub Pages site](https://chenxuli2001.github.io/Group-7-Project-3/), showcasing reproducible code, visual insights, and detailed documentation.
