## Project 3 Description

This project represents the final stage of our multi-phase pipeline analyzing FSRDC-related research outputs. It involved consolidating datasets from eight independent student groups, each of which explored top researchers, institutions, and topics using different methodologies.

Our primary objective was to develop a scalable, validated, and enriched dataset that could serve as a unified foundation for advanced analysis. To achieve this, we engineered a robust Python pipeline that:

- Normalized and deduplicated data from over 39,000 raw records
- Applied fuzzy matching and TF-IDF similarity to validate project affiliations
- Enriched incomplete entries using the CrossRef and OpenAlex APIs
- Merged final results with official metadata from ResearchOutputs.xlsx

We then conducted a series of analytical tasks using Python:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Top RDCs by output volume
- Most prolific authors
- Publication trends and citation distribution
- Time-to-publication lag

### Machine Learning and NLP:
- Trained classification models to predict output status
- Performed PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Clustered documents using K-Means and Agglomerative methods
- Applied LDA topic modeling to identify core research themes
- Conducted sentiment analysis on research abstracts
- Built a document similarity network to reveal local content clusters

### Trend & Network Analysis:
- Tracked keyword frequency shifts over time
- Clustered authors based on aggregated research themes
- Visualized document interconnections via a degree distribution network

All findings are published on our interactive [GitHub Pages site](https://chenxuli2001.github.io/Group-7-Project-3/), showcasing reproducible code, visual insights, and detailed documentation.
